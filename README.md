News Retrieval and Embedding System (RPP RSS Feed)

The objective of this project is to develop an automated system capable of retrieving and semantically organizing news articles from the RPP RSS feed. The system aims to demonstrate the application of modern Natural Language Processing techniques to information retrieval, enabling structured access, storage, and query of real-time news data within a reproducible and scalable workflow.
